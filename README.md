# Shopee - Price Match Guarantee
The "Shopee - Price Match Guarantee" project aims to match similar products using their images and product descriptions. It is based on the Kaggle competition with the same name. The goal of the competition is to develop a model that can accurately identify matching products from the Shopee e-commerce platform.

The project implements three different approaches to product matching. The first approach utilizes image embeddings generated by the EfficientNetB4 model. The second approach focuses on text data and leverages the Bert and TF-IDF vectorization technique to represent product descriptions. The third approach combines both image embeddings and text representations to further enhance matching accuracy.
